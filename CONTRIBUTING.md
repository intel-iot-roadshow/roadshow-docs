## Markdown files

All content (with a few exceptions) are written in Markdown, mixed with some HTML. The flavour of Markdown used by the current Jekyll templating system is 'kramdown'.

### Templating

All content files (found in the 'docs' folder) must start with a snippet like this:

```
---
layout: default
title: Getting Started
---
```

### Headings

Headings get `id` attributes automatically generated for them. To create a table of contents, wrap it in a `div` with `id="toc" class="box" markdown="1"`. Setting `markdown="1"` means that you can write markdown within the html block. An example Table of Contents:

```
<div id="toc" markdown="1">
* [Install Intel® Edison standalone drivers »](#install-intel-edison-standalone-drivers)
* [Install FTDI serial drivers »](#install-ftdi-serial-drivers)
* [Restart your computer »](#restart-your-computer)
</div>
```

### Videos

Let's comment out videos for now but eventually they will look be embedded on the page with width="565" and height="367". For example:

```
<div id="related-videos" class="callout video">
  <object id="flashObj" width="565" height="367" ...
  <embed ... name="flashObj" width="565" height="367" ...></embed></object>
</div>
```

### TLDR summary

The html for summary boxes for each section (with the blue roadsign icon, which I call the "Too long, didn't read" box) look like this:

```
<div class="tldr" markdown="1">
Some 1-2 sentence blurb
</div>
```

### Callout boxes

The html for other callboxes boxes look like this:

```
<div class="callout info" markdown="1">
**Bolded Title (optional)**

Some stuff.
</div>
```

Or when there are multiple items, use a horizontal rule to divide them.

```
<div class="callout info" markdown="1">
**First Title**

First thing

---

**Second Title**

Second thing
</div>
```

Check the CSS file for final callout box options but so far they are:

* info
* goto
* troubleshooting
* done
* warning
* danger


### Next steps

The closing (blue) box at the bottom of the page has this markup:

```
<div id="next-steps" class="note" markdown="1">
Link with where to go next
</div>
```


## Style Guide

Many of these docs originated as a Google Doc and PDFs. Some of the points in the [original style guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C-UeNNmMEX-wXcJLTrflbCm_L93bq3g0aa2CTHNf6Aw/preview) may not apply to these Markdown docs but still worth a read. 

### Language

* Explain what **and why** but keep it short and sweet.
* Keep "skimmability" in mind at all times. No one reads every word so make important ones **jump** out using bold or italics.
* Use numbered lists and bullet points. Avoid rambling in paragraphs.
* Make the content impersonal, gender neutral, and action-oriented -- this content is meant to be re-used across different mediums and platforms. Jokes do not translate well.

### Images

* **Show, don't tell**: Add screenshots and/or photos for clarity.
* However, having said that, even when using an image **do not leave out text-based instructions** for accessibility reasons.
* For ease of translation, do not put text overlays in images. Use numbered or lettered captions, if necessary.
* To show an action, put together a before & after montage or consider an [animated gif](https://github.com/vvo/gifify).
* Use #ff8c00 orange for callout arrows and circles. (Avoid #e21f20 red callouts unless it is actually an indication of an error or danger.)
* Crop images to bring extra attention to the important area and to save space — but make sure to keep context (ie. don't overcrop).
* Compress your images before adding to the repo. Try [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) or similiar tools.

#### Icons

To add folder, file, or bookmark icons to highlight text, add the `.icon` and appropriate (`.folder`, `.file`, or `.bookmark`) CSS class.

```
Refer to [Link text](/page.html){: .icon .bookmark}.
```

or

```
Copy <span class="icon file">something.exe</span>.
```

#### Animated gifs

* Screencasts are recorded and edited in Screenflow for HD (1920 x 1080) video
* A snippet of the recording is pulled out and used for the gif
  * The first frame is exported as the first frame still (650 x 366)
  * Export from Screenflow: Web - High at 34% size (so it's 652 wide)
  * Then, gifify. (I use the [vvo/gifify](https://github.com/vvo/gifify) fork)
    * For camera-based recordings (usually more colors): 
    ```
    gifify animated.mp4 --output animated.gif --colors 200 --fps 3 --compress 0 --resize 650:-1
    ```
    * For screencasts:
    ```
    gifify animated.mp4 --output animated.gif --colors 175 --fps 3 --compress 0 --resize 650:-1
    ```
    * consider `--fps 4` if animation is too quick
* In the markdown, insert an "empty image" but with `data-still` and `data-animated` values (note: image file path must be resolvable from the location of the file that you're inserting this markdown into:
  ```
  ![Animated gif: installing the plastic spacers](){: .animated data-still="images/spacer_install-firstframe.jpg" data-animated="images/spacer_install-animated.gif"}
  ```
* If you don't need the image/gif to show up on viewports smaller than 650px, add a `.hide-small` class. For example, on a details page, when the first frame of the animated gif is the same or very similar to an image at the beginning of the page, it'll be better not to show the still. 
  ```
  ![Animated gif: installing the plastic spacers](){: .animated .hide-small data-still="images/spacer_install-firstframe.jpg" data-animated="images/spacer_install-animated.gif"}
  ```

### Command line input

* Make commands that a reader needs to type jump out and easy to copy/paste by using a single backtick (\`) or [triple backticks](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/#fenced-code-blocks) (```) for multiple lines.

### Code samples

* Make code easy to copy/paste -- use [triple backticks](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/#fenced-code-blocks) (```) for code blocks.
* 2 spaces (not tabs)

## Possible additions

### Want to add a new breakout board?

1. Add it to the main [README.md](README.md)
2. Create a sub-folder in the [assembly folder](/assembly) for the new board
  * Create a doc for **assembly**
  * And another **connecting_cables** doc that is more like an appendix
3. Create an end-to-end guide in the [START_HERE folder](START_HERE/) for some basic Hello World app

### Want to add a new sensor kit?

1. Create a sub-folder in the [sensor examples folder](/sensor_examples) for the new kit
  * Create an **intro** doc
  * Put code samples into a language specific folder (since there will likely be different screenshots/gifs/videos for different languages)
