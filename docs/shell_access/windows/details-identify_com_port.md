## Identify the serial COM port

Use Device Manager to find the COM port number for the "**USB Serial Port**" connection. You will need the COM # to configure PuTTY in Establish a serial connection.

1. Open Device Manager.

    _Don't know how? Refer to [Confirm Drivers â†’ Open Device Manager](../../computer_setup/windows/confirm_drivers.html#open-windows-device-manager)._

2. Scroll down to the "**Ports (COM & LPT)**" section.

3. **Make a note of your COM #** for the "**USB Serial Port**" device. 

    Do ***not*** use the COM number for "Intel Edison USB Composite Device" or "Intel Edison Virtual Com Port". Those are for other features.

    Use the COM # shown on ***your*** computer's Device Manager. In the screenshot, it is "COM3" but your computer will have unique COM port number assignments and may be different from the screenshot.
