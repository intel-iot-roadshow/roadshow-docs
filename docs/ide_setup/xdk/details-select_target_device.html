  <p><strong>Problems with Wi-Fi? Need to program while offline?</strong></p>

  <p>The Intel® XDK requires the IP address of your IoT board in order to program it. If your IoT board is online, the IP address is automatically detected in most cases. </p>

  <p>However, if you are unable to get your IoT board online to the same network as your computer due to restricted or busy Wi-Fi networks, try a direct cable-based method and <a href="troubleshooting.md#add-a-device-manually">Add a device manually</a> to the drop down list.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Intel® Galileo users:</strong></p>

      <p>Connect an Ethernet cable directly from your computer to the Intel® Galileo.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Intel® Edison users:</strong></p>

      <p>Use the device mode micro-USB cable to establish an “Ethernet over USB” connection. Refer to <a href="/connectivity/ethernet_over_usb/">Ethernet over USB</a> for further instruction.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <hr />

  <p><strong>Do not see your device in the “IoT Device” drop down list?</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Check that your Intel® IoT board is online via Wi-Fi or ethernet, and that your development computer is on the same network as the IoT board.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>If your internet network requires additional login credentials (e.g. a university Wi-Fi network), you may need to add the IP address manually. Refer to <a href="troubleshooting.md#add-a-device-manually">Add a device manually</a> in the Troubleshooting appendix.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>If you are using Ethernet over USB for the Intel® Edison, or a direct Ethernet connection for the Intel® Galileo, you may need to add the IP address manually. Refer to <a href="troubleshooting.md#add-a-device-manually">Add a device manually</a> in the Troubleshooting appendix.</p>
