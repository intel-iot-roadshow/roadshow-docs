  <p><strong>Problems with Wi-Fi? Need to program while offline?</strong></p>

  <p>The Intel® XDK requires the IP address of your IoT board in order to program it. If your IoT board is online, the IP address is automatically detected in most cases. </p>

  <p>However, if you are unable to get your IoT board online to the same network as your computer due to restricted or busy Wi-Fi networks, try <a href="../../connectivity/ethernet_over_usb/">Ethernet over USB</a> and <span class="icon bookmark"><a href="troubleshooting.html#add-a-device-manually">Add a device manually</a></span> to the drop down list.</p>

  <p><strong>Do not see your device in the “IoT Device” drop down list?</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Check that your Intel® IoT board is online via Wi-Fi or ethernet, and that your development computer is on the same network as the IoT board.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>If your internet network requires additional login credentials (e.g. a university Wi-Fi network), you may need to add the IP address manually. Refer to <span class="icon bookmark"><a href="troubleshooting.html#add-a-device-manually">Add a device manually</a></span> in the Troubleshooting appendix.</p>

      <p>If you are using Ethernet over USB for the Intel® Edison, you may need to add the IP address manually. Refer to <span class="icon bookmark"><a href="troubleshooting.html#add-a-device-manually">Add a device manually</a></span> in the Troubleshooting appendix.</p>
