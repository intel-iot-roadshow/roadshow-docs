## Don't see your device in the "IoT Device" drop down list?

### Add a device manually

You will need to add the IP address of your IoT device manually if you are using:

* Ethernet over USB for the Intel® Edison, 
* a direct ethernet connection for the Intel® Galileo, or
* an internet network that requires additional login credentials (e.g. a university Wi-Fi network)

1. From the "**IoT Device**" drop down list, select "**Add Manual Connection**".

2. For "**Address**", enter the IP address of your board.
  
    For "**Port**", leave as the default "58888".

    **Don't know the IP address?**

    Refer to:

    * [Connect Your Intel Edison to Wi-Fi → Identify the IP address](../../connectivity/wifi/details-identify_ip.html). 
    * Or use 192.168.2.15 if you're using [Ethernet over USB](../../connectivity/ethernet_over_usb/).
    </div>

3. Click "**Connect**" to try connecting to the IoT device using the manual settings.


### Restart the Intel XDK app daemon

The Intel® XDK app daemon may not be running on the Intel® IoT board.

1. Establish a serial connection to your Intel® Galileo or Intel® Edison. {% strip %}{% include shell_access.md %}{% endstrip %}

2. Use the `systemctl` command to enable and restart the xdk-daemon on the IoT board.

    ```
    systemctl enable xdk-daemon
    systemctl restart xdk-daemon
    ```

3. Re-check the "IoT Device" drop down list for your device.
