<p>Turn on Internet Sharing to cut down on Wi-Fi traffic in a crowded room. Sharing your computer’s internet connection also means that you can log into networks that have HTML password pages and then share the connection with the Intel® Edison.
Internet sharing is an optional step but is highly recommended if you are at a hackathon.</p>

  <li>
    <p>Use Terminal to establish a serial connection to the Intel® Edison.</p>

    <p><em>Don’t know how? Refer to <a href="/docs/shell_access/linux/serial_connection.html">Shell Access</a>.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On your Intel® Edison, disconnect from any WiFi networks the board might be logged into using the wireless command line interface (<code>wpa_cli</code>) command:</p>

    <p><code>
 wpa_cli disconnect
</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then use the <code>route</code> command to add a default gateway. Use the same static IP address you set in the <strong>Network</strong> settings in the previous section.</p>

    <p><code>
 route add default gw 192.168.2.2
</code></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<div class="callout done">
  <p>You can now use the Intel® Edison as if it is connected to the internet on its own as long as you keep the device mode micro-USB cable plugged in.</p>

  <p>Try pinging a network from Terminal to make sure the Intel® Edison is connected to the internet through your computer’s network connection:</p>

  <p><code>
ping google.com
</code></p>

  <p>(Use the Ctrl+C keyboard command to exit the ping process.)</p>

  <p>To re-enable WiFi on the Intel® Edison, use the <code>configure_edison --wifi</code> command as described in <a href="/docs/connectivity/wifi/connect.html">Connect Your Intel Edison to Wi-Fi</a>.</p>

<div class="callout troubleshooting">
  <p><strong>Unable to ping anything from the Intel® Edison?</strong></p>

  <p>Unplug and replug the device mode micro-USB cable to reset the Ethernet over USB connection.</p>
