## Set Up Ethernet over USB - Windows

When you are in a busy or restricted network environment, connect to the Intel® Edison using the device mode micro-USB cable and a virtual Ethernet connection known as "Ethernet over USB". Ethernet over USB uses the RNDIS protocol.

This document will guide you through obtaining an IP address for the Intel® Edison in order to program your board offline using the Intel® IoT Developer Kit IDEs.

## Add static IPv4 address

<div class="tldr" markdown="1">
If you have the Intel® Edison Drivers installed, update your computer's Network Adapter configuration with a static IP address to use Ethernet over USB.

## Share your computer's WiFi connection (optional)

<div class="tldr" markdown="1">
Turn on Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) to cut down on Wi-Fi traffic in a crowded room. Sharing your computer's internet connection also means that you can log into networks that have HTML password pages and then share the connection with the Intel® Edison. Internet sharing is an optional step but is highly recommended if you are at a hackathon.
