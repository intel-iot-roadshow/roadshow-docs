<p>Use the top micro-USB port in USB device mode for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>5V power, </li>
  <li>programming the Intel® Edison using the Arduino IDE, </li>
  <li>programming the Intel® Edison using the Intel® XDK or Eclipse IDE included in the Intel® IoT Developer Kit via Ethernet over USB (not Wi-Fi), and</li>
  <li>writing to the onboard flash memory from your computer.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Find the microswitch in between the USB ports on the expansion board. <br />
Switch the microswitch <em>down</em> towards the micro-USB ports, if it isn’t already.<br />

  <li>
    <p>Plug a micro-USB cable into the <strong><em>top</em></strong> micro-USB connector on the expansion board.<br />

  <li>
    <p>A green LED should light up on the expansion board. Wait one minute for the Intel® Edison to finish booting up.<br />

  <p><strong>How do you know when the board is ready?</strong></p>

  <p>You will know that the Intel® Edison is fully initialized when your computer mounts a new drive (much like inserting a SD card into your computer).</p>

  <hr />

  <p>The Intel® Edison needs approximately one minute to go through the entire Linux startup process. There is no onboard LED to indicate whether or not the Intel® Edison is fully initialized, however you can watch the full bootup sequence (whether for fun or for debugging purposes) if you are connected to the board via the bottom micro-USB cable. You will learn how to gain command line access to your Intel® Edison later in <a href="../../shell_access/">Shell Access</a>.</p>
