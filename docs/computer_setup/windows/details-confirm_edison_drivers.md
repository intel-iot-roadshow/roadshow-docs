**Do not see Intel® Edison devices show up in Device Manager?**

* Check that the Intel® Edison is in **device mode**.
  * Arduino expansion board: the microswitch is toggled downwards.
  * Xadow expansion board: the microswitch is toggled towards "Device" label.
* Check that the micro-USB cable is securely connected to the device mode micro-USB port of the Intel® Edison expansion board.
* Restart your computer to ensure driver changes to take effect.
* Try a different micro-USB cable to eliminate errors due to a bad cable.
* Update the firmware on the Intel® Edison. Refer to [Flash Edison Firmware Manually](../../flash_firmware/manually.html).
