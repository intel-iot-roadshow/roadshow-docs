## Download and run the Intel® Edison integrated installer

The Windows 64-bit Integrated Installer gives you options to automatically install:

* Intel® Edison and FTDI serial drivers on your Windows computer,
* an IDE of your choice (Arduino, Intel XDK® for IoT, and/or Eclipse), and
* the latest firmware image on your Intel® Edison.

4. Follow the installation wizard. Click "**Next**" where needed. 

5. When done, click "**Finish**" to close the installation wizard.

**Is the "Next" button greyed out?**

The integrated installer is unable to detect your Intel® Edison. Ensure that the board is powered on and plugged into your computer via the device mode micro-USB port on the expansion board.

Otherwise you will need to install the Windows drivers manually. Go to [Set Up Your Computer - Windows (manual installation) »](manual_installation.html)

The default settings can be adjusted to your needs, or leave the defaults as is.
